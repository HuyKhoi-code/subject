# Given an integer representing a given amount of change, write a
# function to compute the total number of coins required to make
# that amount of change. You can assume that there is always a
# 1Â¢ coin.
# eg. (assuming American coins: 1, 5, 10, and 25 cents)
# makeChange(1) = 1 (1)
# makeChange(6) = 2 (5 + 1)
# makeChange(49) = 7 (25 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
